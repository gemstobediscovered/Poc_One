## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose


This Technical Design Document (TDD) outlines the architecture, components, interfaces, and data design for the AI-Powered Legal Document Intelligence Platform. The platform aims to revolutionize how legal professionals interact with complex documents by leveraging artificial intelligence for analysis, workflow automation, and insight generation. This document serves as a blueprint for the development team, ensuring alignment and providing a comprehensive technical specification.
### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

- Enhance Efficiency: Significantly reduce time spent by legal teams on manual document review, analysis, and comparison
- Improve Accuracy: Minimize human error in tasks like clause identification, PII redaction, and deadline tracking
- Mitigate Risk: Ensure compliance and security through robust access controls, audit trails, and reliable data handling
- Enable Insights: Provide powerful Q&A capabilities and reporting to extract valuable information from large document sets
- Seamless Integration: Integrate smoothly with existing legal workflows and tools like Microsoft Outlook/Teams and SharePoint

### 1.3 Scope

#### In Scope:

- Secure user authentication and role-based access control
- Document upload, storage (including versioning), and management (supporting formats like PDF, DOCX)
- AI-powered natural language question-answering based on uploaded documents
- Automated extraction and classification of predefined legal clauses
- Comparison of multiple document versions or related documents, highlighting differences
- AI-assisted redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive data
- Automated tracking of key dates and deadlines identified within documents
- Integration with Microsoft Outlook/Teams for deadline notifications
- Integration with SharePoint for document sourcing/storage (optional)
- Comprehensive audit logging of user and system actions
- Reporting dashboards via Power BI integration

#### Out of Scope:

- Providing legal advice or interpretation
- Automated contract generation or negotiation
- E-discovery case management features beyond document analysis
- Direct editing of native document formats within the platform (focus is on analysis and derived work products like redacted versions)
- Support for non-English languages (initially)

### 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

- Cloud Platform: Solution deployed exclusively on Microsoft Azure
- AI Service: Azure OpenAI as primary provider for large language model (LLM) capabilities
- Identity Provider: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for user authentication
- Connectivity: Users have reliable internet connectivity
- Data Residency: Data residency requirements must be adhered to based on client location and Azure region capabilities
- Budget/Resource Constraints: Development and operational activities subject to allocated budgets and team availability
